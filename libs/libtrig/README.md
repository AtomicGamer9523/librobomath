# LibTrig

## Trigonometry functionality (angles, vectors, etc.)

Uses [`l2math`](../l2math/) for math functions.

It is primarily intended to be used by other libraries that require trigonometry functionality. Such as [`libodo`](../libodo/) for odometry, and [`libpath`](../libpath/) for pathing.
